## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- MySQL database

---

### Database Setup

1. Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible.
2. Create a database (e.g. `task_manager`).
3. Run the SQL script at `backend/src/db/init_postgres.sql` to create the necessary tables.

**Schema Note:**
- The `due_datetime` column is now a `TEXT` field and stores the original natural language string (e.g., '20th June, 11pm'), not a date/time value.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=task_manager
   PORT=3000
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory with the following content:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```
